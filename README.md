## Notes

This is my first react-redux app. My Thoughts:

- React. Makes. Life. Easy. 
- Components. Are. The. Best. Thing. In. The. World.
- Redux. Is. Amazing.

React was easy to learn, redux needed a bit more of a learning curve.

- I enabled CSS modules because I like the idea of each component getting its own css file scoped to it. I didn't have to worry about collisions, and styling felt much "cleaner".

- Lazy Loading: I used lazy loading for the Auth, Checkout and Orders Components. This is really unnecessary for an app of this size, but I did it for practice anyway.

- Used axios interceptors.

## Next Steps

- Build an app using the MERN stack!
